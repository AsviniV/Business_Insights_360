## üîå Importing Data into Power BI
Data is imported from a **MySQL** database into Power BI using appropriate credentials.

---

## üß± Data Modeling
We adopted a **Snowflake Schema** design for robust performance and scalability. Good data modeling is crucial, as all visuals depend on this foundation.

## üé® Dashboard Design

### Home View
Includes buttons to navigate between views:
- Info  
- Finance View  
- Sales View  
- Marketing View  
- Supply Chain View
